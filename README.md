Used personally to automate sounds, hotkeys, and replay buffer actions.

### replay_start.lua
**Purpose:** Automatically starts the replay buffer when OBS launches.

**Known Issue:** The OBS taskbar/tray icon does not update to show that the replay buffer is active. 
Functionally, the buffer is running and saves will work normally.
